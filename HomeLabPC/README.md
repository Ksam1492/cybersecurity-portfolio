## üß± Virtual Machines

| VM Name        | OS            | Role                                  |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Kali           | Kali Linux    | Attacker / Pentesting toolkit         |
| Ubuntu         | Ubuntu Server | Hardening, services, and SSH testing  |
| Ubuntu-DVWA    | Ubuntu Clone  | Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) for testing |

- All VMs are connected via a **Host-Only VirtualBox Network** for internal traffic and isolation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Projects (Planned or In Progress)

- [x] Install and configure DVWA on Ubuntu
- [x] Set up isolated VirtualBox network for multi-VM communication
- [ ] Web vulnerability testing with **BurpSuite**, **sqlmap**, and **nikto**
- [ ] Server hardening with **UFW**, **fail2ban**, and SSH configs
- [ ] Vulnerability scans with **Nmap**, **OpenVAS**, or **Nessus**
- [ ] Bash/Python automation scripts for recon/log parsing
- [ ] Internal network mapping and lateral movement simulation
- [ ] CTF-style challenge builds and walkthroughs
