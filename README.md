Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio — a hands-on collection of labs, technical reports, policy documents, presentations, and tools developed through coursework and personal projects. This repository showcases my practical skills in system administration, penetration testing, secure network configuration, cryptographic analysis, and cybersecurity policy development.

### 📦 What You'll Find in This Repo:

- 🧠 **Cybersecurity Presentations**  
  Video walkthroughs, PowerPoint slides, and tools demonstrating topics like Tor, tracert, OWASP A06, Caesar Ciphers, and wireless scanning with WiGLE.

- 🧪 **HomeLabPC Projects**  
  A virtualized home lab using Kali Linux and Ubuntu on a headless Windows 10 machine. Includes a home network penetration test with supporting documentation.

- 📁 **Formal Reports & Policies**  
  NIST- and ISO-aligned policy writeups on mobile security, disaster recovery, access control, and more.

- 🛠 **Custom Security Tools**  
  Hands-on tools like a Caesar Cipher breaker built in Excel/Sheets, used to demonstrate brute-force and encryption basics.
