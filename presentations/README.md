# 🎥 Cybersecurity Presentations

Welcome to my growing collection of short cybersecurity presentations and tool demonstrations. Each folder contains a recorded video, a slide deck, and (where applicable) supporting tools, scripts, or written transcripts used in the session.

These projects were created through academic coursework and personal experimentation, and currently cover topics such as:

- Web security practices and customer data protection  
- Wireless reconnaissance with WiGLE.net  
- Network path tracing using `tracert`  
- Anonymous web browsing with Tor Browser  
- OWASP Top 10: Outdated components  
- Classical encryption (Caesar/Shift Ciphers)  
- The impact of hate crimes in digital spaces

---

## 🗂️ Each Folder Contains:

- A `README.md` with a summary and topics covered  
- A PowerPoint slide deck (`.pptx`)  
- A link to the unlisted YouTube presentation  
- Optional tools, transcripts, or reference materials

📌 This folder demonstrates my technical communication skills, cybersecurity knowledge, and ability to present complex ideas clearly through hands-on demos and video presentations.
